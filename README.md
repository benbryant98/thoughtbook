## Description

Thoughtbook is designed to be the basis for a social media website. Users can share their thoughts, react to other thoughts, and add friends for an enchanced experience.
This project acts as a foundation for the creation of a social media application.
Working on ThoughtBook has given me a solid understanding of how data is given and received in a MongoDB baased backend. I have also learned that I prefer NoSQL over SQL when developing methods for handling my data.
